# LTXMK: A LaTeX build system

LTXMK is intended to be a replacement for [latexmk](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html)

## Problems to be addressed

- If an error takes place in continuous mode, it will not try to recompile once
 the error is fixed
 - Cannot run continuously on multiple files
 - Bad defaults around PDF and output folder and build files
 - Arcane custom dependency rules
 - Poor CI support

## Status
Currently LTXMK is being developed and does not work.
